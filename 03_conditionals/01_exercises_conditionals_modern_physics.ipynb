Prof. McDonough then selected the most pedagogically relevant exercises and prompted the LLM to create a Jupyter notebook with appropriate notes and the selected exercises. The generated content was read thoroughly for accuracy and changes were made. For instance, before corrections, the EM spectrum regions incorrectly left open the bounds for UV and IR radiation. \n",
