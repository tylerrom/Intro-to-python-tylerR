**Instructions to open in Github Codespaces:**
To open in Github Codespaces, click the green "Code" button above, select the "Codespaces" tab and either create a new Codespace or open an existing one. 

**Instructions for using on personal computer:**
If you haven't yet cloned the intro-to-python repository: Make sure you have VS Code, Python, and Github Desktop installed on your computer. Then, follow these steps:
1. Open Github Desktop and clone the repository to your local machine. (File>Clone Repository). Enter the URL: https://github.com/Prof-McDonough/intro-to-python
2. Once cloned, there should be an option to "Open in VS Code" in Github Desktop. Click that to open the repository in VS Code.
3. Follow steps 3 and 4 below. 

If you have already cloned the intro-to-python repository:
1. Open Github Desktop and make sure you have the latest version of the repository by clicking "Fetch origin" in the top right corner.
2. Open the repository in VS Code.
3. Complete the assignments, committing periodically as you work. You should be able to do this in VS Code using the Source Control tab on the left sidebar. The number next to the Source Control icon indicates how many changes you have made that have not yet been committed. You do not need to Sync Changes until you are completely finished with the week's assignment.
   - Before committing, review your changes in the Source Control tab. Any modified files will be listed. To see what modifications were made, you can click on the "M" icon next to each file to see a side-by-side comparison of the changes.
   - Write a meaningful commit message describing the changes you made (e.g., "Completed exercise 1.2 on markdown formatting").
   - Click the checkmark icon to commit your changes to your local repository.
4. When you are finished with the assignment, make sure to push your commits to the remote repository by either: 
   - clicking "Push origin" in Github Desktop
   - using the 'Sync Changes' option in the Source Control tab in VS Code.
   - IMPORTANT: Your instructor cannot see your work until you have pushed your commits to the remote repository
